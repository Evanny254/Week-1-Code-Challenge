# Week-1-Code-Challenge
Welcome to Toy problems code challenge project.In this code challenge i am going to solve three code challeges namely:
1. Student Grade Calculator
2.Speed Detector
3.Net salary Calculator
# Student Grade Calculator
This Javascript program calculates the grade of a student based on their marks according to specified criteria.
The grade is determined using the following criteria:
Grade A: For marks between 80-100
Grade B: For marks between 60-79
Grade C: For marks between 50-59
Grade D: For marks between 40-49
Grade E: For marks between 0-39
Invalid Grade: For marks not defined or not within the range 0-100
# Speed Detector
The JavaScript function calculates demerit points based on a car's speed and determines whether the license should be suspended or not.
>Function
The function calculateDemeritPoints(speed) takes the speed of a car as an input and calculates demerit points based on the following criteria:

If the speed is within the speed limit (70 km/h), it prints "OK".
If the speed exceeds the speed limit, it calculates demerit points and prints "Still Ok" if within the demerit points threshold (<= 12 points). If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License Suspended".

>Parameters
speed: The speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h).
>Constants
speedLimit: The speed limit in kilometers per hour (70 km/h).
rateOfDemeritPoints: The rate of demerit points per km over the speed limit (5 points per km over the limit).
